New Model Specs:
-Keep our model for updating speed
-Change everything else to what Dr Macklin has
-Model from presentation has no chemotactic influence. We'll add this
by computing it separately based on existing code, and using a new 
sensitivity variable to tune how much to listen to that.
-Keep ECM file writing function. It'll need to be changed though
because ECM is now a microenvironment density, like oxygen, so
we need to access the ECM stats differently. (see powerpoint for that)
-Need to update Makefile (probably) to reflect new changes.
-Need to change ECM field initiation. Current code from new model
has ECM density permanently 0 outside of a 200x200 voxel square in
the center of the mesh.

Questions About New Model:
-What is the initial density value for the areas not zeroed manually?
-How is this density updated?

Steps to Answer These Questions:
-Make changing the ECM data to file printing function a first step after
integrating Dr Macklin's code as is. Then, let's graph the density using
a heatmap in matlab and see what the field looks like. This will also
give us insight into if the ECM density is being changed at all.
-Look into user guide about how microenvironment density things (like O2)
are updated/decay.

Possible Problems:
-It seems like the ECM density should decay, given that it is a
microenvironment density thing like oxygen, but I really don't think
the fiber alignment is being updated by the cells at all, so we lose
the two way interaction of our previous model. That would need to be added
somehow.
